# .foo

This is a collection of configuration files I am using. Each directory addresses
a specific application. Installation instructions can be found in the readmes of
the subdirectories.

The repository heavily depends on submodules. Once you cloned it and on some
updates you have to run

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

to get plugins etc which are included as submodules.
