# vim

This is my complete vim configuration.

You can install it with the following lines in your POSIX compatible shell
assuming you have no prior configuration files for vim installed

	DOTVIM=`pwd`
	cd $HOME
	ln -s $DOTVIM .vim
	ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
	ln -s .vim/gvimrc .gvimrc

**TODO**: Update this guide to include installation instructions for YCM and
Syntastic
