# xmodmap

xmodmap lets you change the behaviour of your keyboard. My xmodmap has the
following features:

* The menu key acts as super key (aka tux, cmd or windows key). This is useful
  for awesome setups on notebooks which have only one designated super key.
* The right hand sided alt key activates some special characters like umlauts and lambda

# Setup

Link or copy the `Xmodmap` file to a location like `~/.Xmodmap` and make sure

	xmodmap .Xmodmap

gets executed at the beginning of your session.
